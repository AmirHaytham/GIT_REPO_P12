## 🔧 Sample Configurations

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm build
```

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run tests
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed!"
    exit 1
fi

# Check code style
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Linting failed!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "All checks passed!"
exit 0
```

## 📊 Automation Workflow
```
[Code Push] --> [Automated Tests] --> [Build]
      ↓              ↓                  ↓
[Code Analysis] --> [Security Scan] --> [Deploy]
      ↓              ↓                  ↓
  [Reports] --> [Notifications] --> [Monitoring]
```
